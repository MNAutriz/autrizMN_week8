## Code Description

The code includes the walkthrough in the basics of REACTJS. Starting with App.js, it handles rendering lists of subjects, while Counter.js and WrongCounter.js offer interactive counter components. The main rendering logic is centralized in index.js, while SubjectList.js manages the display and addition of subjects. Additionally, TempConverter.js facilitates temperature conversion between Celsius and Fahrenheit, complete with boiling point detection. Each component plays a crucial role in delivering functionality and enhancing user interaction within the application.

## Things you did in the code

1. App.js renders two lists of subjects, each with their own title.
2. Counter.js provides a simple counter component that increments its value when a button is clicked.
index.js renders the main App component.
3. SubjectList.js displays a list of subjects and allows adding new subjects to the list.
4. TempConverter.js is a temperature converter component that converts between Celsius and Fahrenheit, displaying the temperature and indicating whether it's boiling or not.
5. WrongCounter.js is another counter component similar to Counter.js, but it alerts the updated value after incrementing.
